  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>One of my favorite midweek pasta bakes - my whole family loves it and there is not much prep. </p>
  <p>Once the pasta bake is in the oven, you can make a salad or set the table and then it's time to eat.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <h3></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package penne pasta</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
    <li>1 pound cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
    <li>1 small bunch fresh basil, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>3 (6 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
    <li>3/4 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup of cooking water.</li>
    <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and cook onion until soft and translucent while penne is cooking, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook an additional 30 seconds. Stir in tomato sauce and tomato paste and cook until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Add cream and Parmesan cheese and season with salt, pepper, and sugar.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking dish.</li>
    <li>Stir some pasta cooking water into the sauce and add cooked penne. Remove from heat and stir in cherry tomatoes, 1/2 the mozzarella cheese, and basil. Pour penne mixture into the prepared baking dish and cover with remaining mozzarella cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 20 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
